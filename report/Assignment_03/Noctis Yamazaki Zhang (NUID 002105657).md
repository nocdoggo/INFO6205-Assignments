## Assignment 3 (WQUPC)

### 1. Tasks:

#### 1.1 Step 1

> (a) Implement height-weighted Quick Union with Path Compression. For this, you will flesh out the class UF_HWQUPC. All you have to do is to fill in the sections marked with // TO BE IMPLEMENTED ... // ...END IMPLEMENTATION.

**The code can be seen under the file named `UF_HWQUPC.java`.**

The codes in question are:

```java
    /**
     * Returns the component identifier for the component containing site {@code p}.
     *
     * @param p the integer representing one site
     * @return the component identifier for the component containing site {@code p}
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException unless {@code 0 <= p < n}
     */
    public int find(int p) {
        validate(p);
        int root = p;
        // TO BE IMPLEMENTED

        // using a while loop till the root is the same of the root of the parent, my english sucks
        while (root != parent[root]) {

            // Use the simple boolean checker
            if (pathCompression) {
                // go down the hill
                doPathCompression(root);


                // Dumb fuck for leaving it here. It should be executed regardless
                //root = parent[root];
            }

            root = parent[root];
        }

        // This time, we do need to return the root as the result of the function
        return root;
    }
```

```java
    private void mergeComponents(int i, int j) {
        // TO BE IMPLEMENTED make shorter root point to taller one
        // If both hand sides are the same
        if (i == j) {
            // no shit needs to be done

            // Not sure if necessary
            // count++;
            // height[i]++;

            return;
        }

        // Then we need to check the height of the thing
        // Fucking hell for forgetting the equal condition.

        if (height[i] >= height[j]) {

            // Use the existing function
            updateParent(j, i);
            updateHeight(i, j);

        } else {

            // Reverse order
            updateParent(i, j);
            updateHeight(j, i);

            // I don't know if I am thinking this wrong
        }
    }
```

```java
    /**
     * This implements the single-pass path-halving mechanism of path compression
     */
    private void doPathCompression(int i) {
        // TO BE IMPLEMENTED update parent to value of grandparent
        updateParent(i, parent[parent[i]]);
    }
```



> (b) Check that the unit tests for this class all work. You must show "green" test results in your submission (screenshot is OK). 

![Test Results](img/UF_HWQUPC_Test.png)

#### 1.2 Step 2

**The implementation can be found in the `HWQUPC_Solution.java`.**

No terminal input function is implemented as I am aiming to sweep through an array of numbers for generating the results in `Step 3`.

#### 1.3 Step 3 

15 different numbers of sites have been ran through the program to determine the relationship between the number of object ($n$) and the number of pairs ($m$). For each $n$, ==100== runs were conducted, and an average value was calculated to make the result more generalized.

![Runtime](img/Solution.png)

The results can be found in the ==Exhibition A==.

### **The relationship between $n$ and $m$ shall be $$m \ â‰ˆ \ \frac{1}{2} * n  *   log_2 n .$$** Such can be seen from the plot and analysis down below.

![Result Relationship](img/Real_relationship.png)

By adding a linear trendline, I find out that the $R^2$ value is almost `1`.

> R-squared ($R^2$) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a [regression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regression.asp) model. Whereas correlation explains the strength of the relationship between an independent and dependent variable, R-squared explains to what extent the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable. So, if the R2 of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.                 --------- [R-Squared Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/r-squared.asp)

The equation can be seen as:

![Equation](img/Formula.png)

In this case, nearly 99.99% of observations fall into a linear relationship for $\frac{1}{2} * n  *   log_2 n$ and $m$, which confirms the relationship to be valid.
